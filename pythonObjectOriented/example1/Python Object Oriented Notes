Class attribute:
    Defined in Class
    ex: Class Employee:
            numberOfWorkingHours = 40
Instance attribute:
    Defined in instance of Class   
    ex: employeeOne = Employee()
        employeeOne.name = "Tom"
    Python looks for instance attributes first and upon not finding     any it looks for class attributes
